#Easy form generator (AngularJS)

This is the custom version of easyFormGenerator, based on the original version v1.1.0

My updates:
1. Combine the 0,1,2 steps into one step.
2. Update: You could add at most 6 columns on one row.
2. Update: Custom controls “IP Address”, “Numbers”, ”Section”, “Subsection”, “label” and “Page Break”.
3. New function: Insert any line and Matrix below any line.
4. New function: Add page break to setup view and fix the performance issue if you have huge lines in one Form.
5. New function: Add a key field into any type controls so you could input your own key.
6. New function: Add “Default Value” field to any of the input type like “input”, “IP Address” etc.
7. New function: Add a AutoSave function, which could alert user to save this form ever 30 mins, and you could change this time period.
8. Other layout changes and bug fixes.
